# Presets management

### What is it ?

Thanks to your CDP and the different connexions we have, you can send your audience segments to partners such as Google, AppNexus, Facebook and so on… We call them Feeds. 

For each segment you want to send to a partner, you need to add and configure a Feed. 

Usually, there are few feeds you use regularly. In order to make it easier for you, we give you the opportunity to pre-define some of this feed.   

To avoid creating every-time the same configuration for a feed, you can create presets for server side and client side feeds

These presets will be available at the top of your feed creation.

### How to create a preset ?

Step 1 : you need to make sure you are an admin user of the platform. You are an admin if you can see the following screen when you are in a random segment and then you click on “Add a feed” :

* Choose a random segment & go on “Add a feed”

If you can’t see this, please refer to you account manager.

Step 4 : Field & save a Preset

### Example for AppNexus

Then, save your Preset

### Example for Google Display Products

Then save your preset.

You can proceed with the different feed you need. The set up is quite similar than set up a regular feed. 

No need to fill in all fields, only the preset name and description are mandatory. 

If some other fields are left blank, then your team will be able to modify it when using the preset. If the field is already filled, then your team won’t be able to modify it when using the preset.

Tips : 

1. Add the name of the feed and the name of the product in the Name of your Preset
2. Do not fill the segment code and UserListName fields

The next time that you will need to set up a feed, you will have the created preset on the top of the feeds screen.
