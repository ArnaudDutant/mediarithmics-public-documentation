For GA, you will need to provide your CSM with your Adwords Account ID and log into your Adwords account: \([https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response\_type=code&client\_id=674084608389-3sjvgv45js1pp6aq5tupp3gmrofip8p4.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect\_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fadwords](https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth?response_type=code&client_id=674084608389-3sjvgv45js1pp6aq5tupp3gmrofip8p4.apps.googleusercontent.com&redirect_uri=urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob&scope=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.googleapis.com%2Fauth%2Fadwords)\) to authorize mediarithmics  


The authorization code is only valid for 15 minutes. We therefore advise you to schedule a call with your CSM and your Google Ads Admin to setup the autorization.
