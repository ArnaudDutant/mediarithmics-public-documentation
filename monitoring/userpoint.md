A user point is **a 360° vision of a unique user in the platform**.‌  
It is composed of different sets of data to cover all the user aspects providing a 360° view \(online and offline\):‌

* ​[User activities](https://app.gitbook.com/@mediarithmics/s/developer-guide/getting-started/user-activities) represent an interaction with the user
* ​[User profiles](https://app.gitbook.com/@mediarithmics/s/developer-guide/getting-started/user-profiles) represent a summary of timeless information about the user, like first name, last name, birth date...
* ​[User segments](https://app.gitbook.com/@mediarithmics/s/developer-guide/getting-started/segments) are here to capture that the user belongs to a particular group of users
* ​[User choices](https://app.gitbook.com/@mediarithmics/s/developer-guide/guides/data-privacy-compliance/user-choices) capture that the user has given his consent for a specific type of data processing
