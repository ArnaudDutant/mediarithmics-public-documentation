# What is a segment?

An Audience segment allows to define cohorts of users within the datamart.

The cohort of users described by the segment share the same characteristics. They can be based on demographics \(gender, age,  geographic location..\) , on behavior \(website categories visits, purchases, types of purchased products..\), on computed traits \(statistical algorithms and scores\)

These segments can be activated in DSP campaigns in mediarithmics platform or synched to destinations or available via mediarithmics API.

The segments are used to measure marketing performances of campaigns and target specific marketing targets with personalized offers/messages

## Why is audience segmentation important for marketing strategies?

Audience segmentation allows marketers to transition from mass communication to personalized communication matching the different segments needs.

With audience segmentation techniques, marketers are leveraging data to precisely understand and anticipate users segments expectations and needs. 

They are able to tailor more focused messages and communication strategies through the entire sale lifecycle.

## What are the different types of segmentations in mediarithmics?

mediarithmics offers different methods to create your audience segments:

1. By an explicit list of users \(type USER\_LIST\). The user list method is used when you want to import a list of User Identifiers.
2. By a query on the Audience Datamart \(type USER\_QUERY\). The user query method allows to create a segment of users complying to the same  multi criteria query
3. By a statistical algorithm \(type USER\_LOOKALIKE\)
4. By a predefined partition model \(type USER\_PARTITION\)
5. By being automatically generated in a campaign \(type USER\_ACTIVATION\)
