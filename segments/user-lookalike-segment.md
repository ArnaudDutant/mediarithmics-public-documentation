# User lookalike segment

## What is it ?

From whatever segment in your own CDP, you can create a lookalike segment. The purpose of this feature, is to allow you increase the reach of your segment using your own 1st party data. 

The Lookalike will be either :   


* Partitions based : 

As we previously explained, your CDP is split by partition. You have between 20 and 100 segments of partition where all your UserPoint are divided into. 

The feature creates an overlap between the initial segment you selected, with 1 to 20 \(or 100\) segments of partition it overlaps the most. The algorithm is based on online activities.

For example, if you want to create a lookalike segment on segment A.

You choose to add up to 2 segments of partition and it figures out that segments of partition that overlap the most are segments M and Z. 

Then, you will have the segment A + the overlap of segment M + overlap of segment Z  


* Or score based : 

Thanks to the platform, you have the opportunity to integrate your own algorithm of score, gender, socio-demographic and so on. 

Please refer to your account manager for this option.  


## Which use cases ?

* Yourself or your clients find that some segments are quite small in terms of UserPoint to activate either for yourself or your client. 
* You want to increase your insight about your own audiences

## How to create a Lookalike segment from partition ?

Step 1 : Select the segment you want to create the lookalike from in the library

Step 2 : Select “Create a Lookalike”

Step 3 : Select “Partition based Lookalike”

Step 4 : Filled & select the following fields

1 : Pick your segment name 

2 : Selection your partition 

3 : Choose your Extension Factor. 1 extension factor correspond to 1 segment of partition. Meaning, if you select 100 over 100 segment partition, you will select the entire DMP. 

We advise you to begin with small extension factor and test your new segment before increase the reach. In order to check the relevancy of your segment.

Step 5 : Save your records

Step 6 : Calibrate your segment

Then it’s over, we need to wait until it’s fully populated and you can use your segment either in a mediarithmics DSP campaign, send your segment through one of our feed or get some learnings about your audiences.

I remind you that if you need to increase the volume of your segment, you can use also the overlap feature, you can as well integrate 2d and 3d party data or include your own algorithm to score your audience.  


Step 7 : Recalibrate your segment

Segment partition change during time. They populated with all the new users you have in your database. In order to integrate these new users in your look alike segment, you can click on “Recalibrate”.
