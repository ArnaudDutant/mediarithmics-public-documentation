# Split

The Split flow control component lets you divide the automation flow into several branches.

For instance, if you choose to divide your flow into 2 branches, then 1 out of 2 users will go on branch A, and the other will go on branch B.

You can configure the number of branches you want to split your flow into. The flow will be split in equal proportions.
