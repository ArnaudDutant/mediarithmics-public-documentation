# What is a scenario?

A scenario is a set of additional marketing or advertising actions which are linked together according to conditional rules and which aim to achieve a marketing objective**.**

In mediarithmics, automation consists in making users enter a scenario based on a specific trigger \(eg: has seen the new Apple phone\). Specific conditions can be added in order to create more complex scenario. A scenario is always programmed to have an exit condition in order to make people leave the scenario when their behaviour do not match anymore the scenario they initially entered.

Let’s imagine a retailer that wants to create the following scenario: send an email communication to potential customers who have added products to their basket but have not yet completed the transaction in 2 hours following the basket creation:

* the retailer has to configure the trigger that will make users enter the automation scenario
* the retailer can add a waiting condition of “2 hours”
* the retailer will add an action node in order to configure the action needed by the scenario, in this case “Send email
* the retailer will add an exit automation to finish the scenario

Ex: translation of the previous scenario in the mediarithmics platform:
