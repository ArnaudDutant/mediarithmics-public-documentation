# What are automations?

Here is a definition for automation:

> **The process of removing human intervention and relying on machines to coordinate repetitive tasks.**

But to better understand what this is about, let's consider the following example.

Let's say you own an online shop and you have customers adding products to their carts, and you want to target those who do not complete their purchase.

Sure, you could manually extract a list of customers everyday and input that list into your email marketing software, but that would get real tedious real fast.

It would be really great if every time a customer adds a product to the cart, an automatic trigger would send an email if eventually there is no purchase. In a nutshell, that's what automation is about.
