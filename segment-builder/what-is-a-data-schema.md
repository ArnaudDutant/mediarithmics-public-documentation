# What is a data schema?

The schema defines the model according which your data is stored and queried :

Any data collected is stored even if it is not specified in the schema and does not contradict the schema. 

The schema states what is indexed in the your environment. By “indexed”, we mean that you can query the data after the platform processed it.

It is evolutive : a new schema can be implemented to substitute the old one without losing historical data because mediarithmics platform is recording all events received in a specific database.

The schema is built to answer your needs regarding the criteria you want to use to query your data.
